Shoot, darn it, expletive, etc.  Why the cursing spree, you ask?  We just found out that Max, otherwise known as Nephew #1, has Diabetes.  It's Type 1, which is the the type you don't want, I'm told.  Oh, and to walk you down the right branch on the family tree, Max is Greg's (Jill's bro) and Beth's first. 

So, what do I do with this information?   I mean, now that I have finished cursing?  It seems a bit unfair, as Max is easily one of the most awesome, super-fantastic kids I know.  In fact, I judge most other kids in his age group (he's 9) using my patented "How Much Cooler is Max Than This Kid" scale.  I travel to Atlanta regularly, and my trips always have a bit of Max-ticipation wondering how and when we will get to hang out.  I fondly remember several baseball games, a couple of GT football games, and seemingly infinite times in the driveway playing <insert any sport here>.  It's during these times that I relish how Max (wrongly) sees me for what he thinks I am.  It's during these times that I am thankful for the gift of the perfect nephew.

So, what do I do with this information?  I mean, now that I have finished the unnecessarily nostalgic pouting?  Nothing has changed, really, has it?  Max is strong and brave and good and Diabetes is quivering and small and cowardly.  Max will crush this bug and be better for it.  He will be a giant among children with diabetes.  I can see it now, Max uses diabetes to end all wars and bring a final and lasting peace to the world.

So, what do I do with this information?  I mean, now that I am through with hyperbole?  I bet a gift would cheer him up.  How about a crisp $20 bill or some new GT stuff?  I know, how about a trip?  Disneyworld?  Europe?  The Moon?  I plan on attending the G8 Summit and asking the world's leaders how much they want for the Earth.  I bet Max would enjoy having an Earth.  Or maybe a Saturn, it has rings, after all, and it hasn't  been messed up by humans (yet).

So, what do I do with this information? I mean, now that I am done promising the world?  Truth be told, I am not sure.  I guess we support him.  I guess we support Greg and Beth.  I guess we take a deep breath.  I guess we let Max know that he is not alone in this; that he has a powerful army with him and Diabetes now has a formidable foe.  I know I need to now be that person he sees, if possible.  I know he will be fine.

So what do we do with this information?  We work and strive and donate and help to find a cure.  We apply ourselves, to The Max.
