Merry Christmas! Happy <whatever you do or don't celebrate>!

This year's letter is, as always, a bit late and chock full of that Goodrich stuff you've been craving.

This year's letter is, however, a bit different. We let Zoe (the dog) write it, as this is her last Christmas with us. Before you get all teary-eyed and blubbery, know that Zoe has had a full life. 

So, [read on](/xmas/2015) and enjoy Christmas from Zoe's point-of-view.
