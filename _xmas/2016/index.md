Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays! Merry end of 2016, which, frankly, can let the door hit it right in the backside on the way out. Between deaths of many beloved celebrities, like Prince, as well as many beloved institutions, like Democracy, 2016 was the obnoxious frat guy of years.

Hey! Did we really mention politics above? Let's steer clear of that, lest this letter one day be used as evidence of why the authors should be put on a registry. HAHAHAHAAHA...erm...HA!

Seriously, though, if any year needs a letter with reasons to laugh, 2016 does. So, we've buckled down to make this letter full of reasons to laugh. We call these reasons the Goodrichs. The format of this year's letter comes in the form of interviews with each of the kids to let them tell you about their year. This has the added benefit of letting you into their psyche just enough to know that you don't want to be let in any further.

In Glenn's case, Jill will perform the interview. We tried letting Glenn interview himself, but he kept getting in shouting matches and, at one point, came out of it with a black eye. It seems he threw his toy Mjolnir (Thor's hammer) at himself.

Ok, when you're ready to appreciate your station in life, read on. Each link below will take you into some version of The Goodrich Home of Peculiar Children (and Pets.)
